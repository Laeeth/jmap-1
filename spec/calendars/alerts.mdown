# Alerts

- Pushed from server? Probably should let you subscribe to type. Not included unless specifically requested though. What is value (not a state string: accountId/eventId/alertId)? Hmm. OK, so not a statechange object then.
- Define expected client behaviour. (MUST NOT send email. How to do snooze, setting acknowledged, etc.)

Default alerts are on calendar.
